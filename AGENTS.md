# OpenSageTV Vibe Core contributor rules

## Task fix and server-boundary policy

Apply this policy to every task workflow, including dependency fixes across
Vibe repositories. Fix and test necessary plugins and update the test-server
plugin without asking again solely for repository-boundary approval.

Prefer the Android client, then a stock-compatible plugin. Change non-stock
`.232` Core only for a proven production defect that neither can correct;
document the API gap and alternatives, keep optional negotiation and safe
stock/older-client fallback, and run affected compatibility tests. Never patch
Core merely to simplify testing.

Stock `.175` installation changes are limited to plugin installation/update.
Do not modify its stock Sage.jar, stock FFmpeg, Core binaries, or server
installation/configuration files. Preserve user settings, recordings and
unrelated clients; reversible supported SageTV playback APIs remain allowed.

Non-stock `.232` restarts are authorized for task updates without asking
again; coordinate them with active test guards and preserve data/settings.
  Always ask the user before restarting stock `.175`, even when it appears idle,
  unless an explicit user-granted bounded restart window is active. Record
  its UTC expiry in the task/handoff, and check expiry and revocation before
  every restart. After expiry or revocation, ask again; stock files stay protected.

Update owning TASKS.md, linked dependencies and the workspace suggested order
as work changes; move completed checkoffs into the checklist change ledger.
Test only affected gates, preserve unrelated completed matrices, and do not
stop independent authorized work for a status question or a dependency-only
permission request. Unrelated work, publication, destructive actions and
interruption of recordings/other users still require their own authority.

Read `README.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, `TASKS.md`, `WORKFLOW.md`, and the Ubuntu 26
audit before changing Core. `TASKS.md` is the only local backlog. Move
completed work to its checklist change ledger and record release evidence in
`CHANGELOG.md` and `HANDOFF.md`.

Do not create prompt/review/per-version notes. Preserve SageTV/JNI ABI, Java 11,
system-libpng behavior, LF executable files, and the one unified Docker
environment. Never commit output, user configuration, credentials, recordings,
or databases. Root launchers must work from any caller directory.

Release validation is impact-based: rerun only gates the release changes could
affect. Do not repeat unrelated completed gates. Run the full gate suite only
when the user explicitly requests it or a broad dependency/architecture change
requires it, and document that reason and scope.


## Stock-server test-control policy

The user authorizes necessary non-stock `.232` production fixes/tests only
after a proven runtime defect cannot be corrected in the Android client or
stock-compatible plugin. Stock compatibility remains preferred. Document the
API gap and alternatives, keep optional negotiation and safe stock/older-
client fallback, and run affected compatibility gates. Never change protected
stock `.175` Core/server files; installation there is limited to plugins.
Do not patch Core just to make a test easier.

- For any new testing, commissioning, diagnostic, or automation control, first
  implement or extend the stock-compatible `opensagetv-vibe-core-MCP-Plugin`
  using supported `sage.SageTV.api`/`apiUI` calls and verify it against an
  unmodified stock SageTV server.
- Do not patch `Sage.jar`, add private MiniClient events, or change Core merely
  to make a test easier. Existing public APIs, the bounded MCP bridge, and
  external test tooling are the required first option.
- Change Core only when the required production runtime behavior cannot be
  expressed through the stock plugin/API boundary. Document the proven API
  gap, keep the extension optional and negotiated with a safe stock fallback,
  and verify older clients and installations remain unaffected.

## Pre-commit task-list maintenance

Immediately before every repository commit, clean `TASKS.md`: move every
completed `[x]` item out of the active task sections and into
`## Checklist change ledger`. Preserve stable IDs, acceptance evidence, order,
and enough source/parent context to understand the result. Never delete
completion history. Active task sections must contain unchecked work only;
checked boxes may appear only inside the checklist change ledger. Regenerate
the project manifest when the repository tracks one.
