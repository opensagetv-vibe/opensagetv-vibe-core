# OpenSageTV Vibe Core contributor rules

Read `README.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, `TASKS.md`, `WORKFLOW.md`, and the Ubuntu 26
audit before changing Core. `TASKS.md` is the only local backlog. Move
completed work to its checklist change ledger and record release evidence in
`CHANGELOG.md` and `HANDOFF.md`.

Do not create prompt/review/per-version notes. Preserve SageTV/JNI ABI, Java 11,
system-libpng behavior, LF executable files, and the one unified Docker
environment. Never commit output, user configuration, credentials, recordings,
or databases. Root launchers must work from any caller directory.

Release validation is impact-based: rerun only gates the release changes could
affect. Do not repeat unrelated completed gates. Run the full gate suite only
when the user explicitly requests it or a broad dependency/architecture change
requires it, and document that reason and scope.


## Stock-server test-control policy

- For any new testing, commissioning, diagnostic, or automation control, first
  implement or extend the stock-compatible `opensagetv-vibe-core-MCP-Plugin`
  using supported `sage.SageTV.api`/`apiUI` calls and verify it against an
  unmodified stock SageTV server.
- Do not patch `Sage.jar`, add private MiniClient events, or change Core merely
  to make a test easier. Existing public APIs, the bounded MCP bridge, and
  external test tooling are the required first option.
- Change Core only when the required production runtime behavior cannot be
  expressed through the stock plugin/API boundary. Document the proven API
  gap, keep the extension optional and negotiated with a safe stock fallback,
  and verify older clients and installations remain unaffected.

## Pre-commit task-list maintenance

Immediately before every repository commit, clean `TASKS.md`: move every
completed `[x]` item out of the active task sections and into
`## Checklist change ledger`. Preserve stable IDs, acceptance evidence, order,
and enough source/parent context to understand the result. Never delete
completion history. Active task sections must contain unchecked work only;
checked boxes may appear only inside the checklist change ledger. Regenerate
the project manifest when the repository tracks one.
